There are a lot of engineering colleges in India, among one of them is **IIIT Delhi**, *my Alma Mater*. This college doesn't rank in the top 10 colleges in India or is not among the oldest colleges in India, but is the fastest growing college in India, in terms of Placements, Culture, Education and every other field that you can think of.

### So what this college can give you?
This college will give you everything you can ever ask for to get you to the top.

This college is a research based institute and will give you a lot of opportunities for pursuing research, will give you a diverse environment with lot of fields you can explore from like Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Algorithm Design, Graphic Design and much more.

Faculties in this institute are working in cutting edge technologies and mentoring students to help them to work in an ever changing environment.

### What's the most important thing that you should see when choosing a college?
In my opinion, it's how a colleges mentors his students. It doesn't depend on how many courses are there, or how educated there faculties are, but how these faculties teaches students is the most important thing. In IIIT Delhi the culture is project based learning i.e. faculties are not going to just teach you theory and spoonfeed everything and then the questions will come from that material.
>It's not like that, they will teach you A, give assignment to solve H, and the questions will come from Z. And seriously that's a good thing.

But in this you are not alone, faculties will always be there with you on your side, the only thing you have to do is ASK.

Today in Internet age, all course materials are available to everyone, same content is available to a student of MIT or IIIT or any home studying student. So the only thing that differentiates you from others is how you consume that material filter out any jitters and mine the knowledge available from within. This is what IIITD teaches us, to **mine the knowledge within and use it in an efficient and scalable way**.

This all teaches you how to study and then you can decide on your own what do you want to study. Computer Science is a vast field and highly changing field. What you had learnt one year back is already deprecated. So in computer science field learning is the most important thing that any college can give you, and this is what IIIT Delhi offers to its students.

## Social Life
Apart from all this, social life is great. You will make an everlasting bond with your friends, collegues and faculties. There are lot of fun activities going all over the week with studies. There are lot of groups that will also teach you programming, designing and what not in fun ways.
